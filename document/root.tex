\begin{abstract}
  \begin{quote}
	Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain, often developed in a high-level programming language, the most popular of which is Solidity.
	Smart contracts are used to automate financial transactions and thus bugs can lead to large financial losses.
	With this paper, we address this problem by describing a verification environment for Solidity in Isabelle/HOL.
	The framework consists of a novel formalization of the Solidity storage model, a shallow embedding of Solidity expressions and statements, an implementation of Isabelle commands to support a user in specifying Solidity smart contracts, and a verification condition generator to support a user in the verification.
	Compliance of the semantics is tested by a set of unit tests and the approach is evaluated by means of three case studies.
	Our results show that the framework can be used to verify even complex contracts with reasonable effort.
	Moreover, they show that the shallow embedding significantly reduces the verification effort compared to an alternative approach based on a deep embedding.

\chapter{Introduction}

The rest of this document is automatically generated from the formalization in
Isabelle/HOL, i.e., all content is checked by Isabelle. The structure follows
the theory dependencies (see \autoref{fig:session-graph}).

\chapter{Preliminaries}
In this chapter, we discuss auxiliary formalizations and functions that
are used in our Solidity semantics but are more generic, i.e., not
specific to Solidity.

\chapter{Stores and State}
In this chapter, we formalize the different types of stores for Solidity.
In particular, we present a formalization for Storage, Memory, Calldata, and Stack.
Then we define the state consisting of a configuration of all the stores as well as account balances.

\chapter{Expressions and Statements}

In this chapter, we formalize expressions and statements as shallow embeddings for Isabelle/HOL.

\chapter{ML Commands}
In this chapter, we present the implementation of the Isabelle commands to specify
a contract and verify invariants.

\chapter{Weakest Precondition Calculus}
In this chapter, we present a weakest precondition calculus and corresponding
verification condition generator.

\input{WP.tex}

\chapter{Unit Tests}

In this chapter, we validate the compliance of the semantics with the official Solidity specification.
To this end we implemented a set of unit tests which were also executed on the Remix IDE.

\input{Unit_Tests.tex}

\chapter{Applications}

In this chapter we present three case studies in which we use Isabelle/Solidity to verify
invariants for Solidity smart contracts.
